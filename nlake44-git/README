Why Develop AppScale?

Our goal with AppScale is to provide a open-source cloud platform that anyone 
can use to deploy your Google App Engines to and to perform research on cloud 
platforms. 

How can I help?

Unit tests help us a lot, so if you'd like to write unit tests for us, we would
appreciate it a lot! We're using flexmock/rcov for mocking and code coverage
information, so Rubyistas should dive in to the AppController, Neptune, or
InfrastructureManager folders and see what could benefit from unit tests there.
Alternatively, adding rdoc to those same projects to get us closer to 100%
documentation would also be great!
